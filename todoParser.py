"""A little script to parse TODO-like statements in source files.

The script parses all (supported) source files in a given path, tries to read
"TODO: do this and that"-like comments and writes these commands to the
terminal.

Source formats supported so far:

*.f90: free-form Fortran 90
*.py: Python
*.pyx: Cython
*.tex: LaTeX
